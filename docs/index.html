<h2>Introduction</h2>
<p>
The Interchange File Format is a simple structured binary file format
consisting of sized and typed chunks of data, selectively readable without
having to know the format of each chunk. This functionality is similar
to what XML provides for text documents, and the IFF format can indeed
be viewed as a sort of a binary XML. IFF's extensibility is an excellent
way of not breaking old applications when the file format changes, making
it an excellent choice for your next application's data files. The IFF
is also the simplest and the smallest such data format, ensuring that
your files consist of real data rather than overhead and that your code
spends more time on real work than on parsing the data file. This library
defines the IFF header structures and provides simple algorithms for
directly writing many of your objects as chunks and containers.
</p>
<h2>Installation</h2>
<p>
Building this library is a fairly standard procedure. Download the package from
<a href="https://github.com/msharov/iff/releases/latest">https://github.com/msharov/iff/releases/latest</a>.
Make sure you have the necessary dependencies: C++ compiler, such as gcc 4.6+, the
<a href="https://github.com/msharov/ustl/releases/latest">uSTL</a> library
version 2.6 or higher.
</p><p>
First, unpack and install uSTL, as described in its documentation.
Unpack libiff and run <kbd>./configure &amp;&amp; make install</kbd>,
which will install the library to /usr/local/lib and headers to
/usr/local/include. <kbd>./configure --help</kbd> lists available
configuration options, in the usual autoconf fashion. The one thing
to be aware of is that by default the library will not be completely
conforming to EA85 specification. Why that is so, and why you should
take the default options anyway, is discussed in detail in the next
section. If you really want to use the original EA85 format, you can to
pass <kbd>--with-bigendian --with-2grain</kbd> to <tt>configure</tt>.
</p><p>
To see the correct link command for your project using libiff, you
can use <kbd>pkg-config --libs --static iff</kbd>. This will include
<kbd>-liff</kbd> and, if uSTL is a static library, <kbd>-lsupc++</kbd>.
</p>
<h2>Usage</h2>
<p>
If you are using C++, chances are you already have an object-oriented
design of some kind. You have a collection of objects, related to each
other in some way, and you want to write them all to a file in some
way. It is, of course, possible to just write them all to the file, one
after the other, but that approach makes things difficult if you ever
decide to change the structure of those objects, write more or fewer of
them, or explain to other people how to read your format. Hence, it is
desirable to create some kind of structure in the file, to be able to
determine where each objects begins and ends, and what kind of object is
where. When using an IFF format, you'll make simple objects into chunks,
and objects containing other objects into FORMs, LISTs, or CATs.
</p><p>
The first task is to make each of your objects readable and writable
through uSTL streams. To do that you'll need to define three methods,
<tt>read</tt>, <tt>write</tt>, and <tt>stream_size</tt>, and create
flow operator overrides with a <tt>STD_STREAMABLE</tt> macro. Here is
a typical example:
</p><pre>
    #include &lt;iff.h&gt;	// iff header includes ustl.h, but doesn't use the namespace.
    using namespace ustl;	// it is recommended to leave iff:: namespace on.

    // Since the object is simple, and contains no other objects, we'll
    // make it a simple chunk. The chunk format is a 4 byte integer. In a
    // hex editor you'll see PLYR at the beginning of the object making it
    // easy to find when you want to hack something in it.
    enum { fmt_PlayerStats = IFF_FMT('P','L','Y','R') };     

    /// Stores player's vital statistics.
    class CPlayerStats {
    public:
	void        read (istream&amp; is)
			{ is &gt;&gt; _hp &gt;&gt; _maxhp &gt;&gt; _mana &gt;&gt; _maxmana; }
	void        write (ostream&amp; os) const
			{ os &lt;&lt; _hp &lt;&lt; _maxhp &lt;&lt; _mana &lt;&lt; _maxmana; }
	size_t      stream_size (void) const
			{ return (stream_size_of (_hp) +	// This evaluates at compile time to 8,
				  stream_size_of (_maxhp) +	// so making this function inline is
				  stream_size_of (_mana) +	// usually a good idea.
				  stream_size_of (_maxmana)); }
    private:
	uint16_t    _hp;
	uint16_t    _maxhp;
	uint16_t    _mana;
	uint16_t    _maxmana;
    };

    STD_STREAMABLE(CPlayerStats)
</pre><p>
This needs to happen in all your objects. Make them streamable and define
a format id. Then, to save everything, use <tt>iff::Read/Write</tt>
functions from <tt>iff/utils.h</tt> like this:
</p><pre>
    void GameObject::SavePlayer (const string&amp; filename) const
    {
	memblock buf (iff::form_size_of (m_Player));	// A buffer to store the file
	ostream os (buf);					// and a stream to write the player object to.
	//
	// This writes it as a FORM, which just happens to be one of the three
	// allowable top-level chunk types. When a file starts with FORM, LIST,
	// or CAT, programs know it is an IFF file. The top level chunk should
	// contain the entire file, and nothing should follow it.
	//
	iff::WriteFORM (os, _player, fmt_MyGamePlayer);
	buf.write_file ("player.sav");
    }

    // The following will be in the player class

    /// Reads the player object from stream \p is
    size_t CPlayer::stream_size (istream&amp; is)
    {
	// Player is a compound object, a FORM, so it can only contain other
	// chunks and FORMs, not simple values.
	return (iff::chunk_size_of (_name) +	// _name is a string
		iff::chunk_size_of (_stats) +	// CPlayerStats object
		iff::vector_size_of (_inventory) + // a vector, chunk saved
		// Quests is a special manager object that writes each quest
		// as a chunk or a form with some common settings.
		iff::list_size_of (_quests));
    }

    /// Reads the player object from stream \p is
    void CPlayer::write (ostream&amp; os) const
    {
	iff::WriteChunk (os, _name, fmt_PlayerName);
	iff::WriteChunk (os, _stats, fmt_PlayerStats);
	iff::WriteVector (os, _inventory, fmt_Inventory);
	iff::WriteLIST (os, _quests, fmt_Quests);
    }

    /// Reads the player object from stream \p is
    void CPlayer::read (istream&amp; is)
    {
	iff::ReadChunk (is, _name, fmt_PlayerName);
	iff::ReadChunk (is, _stats, fmt_PlayerStats);
	iff::ReadVector (is, _inventory, fmt_Inventory);
	iff::ReadLIST (is, _quests, fmt_Quests);
    }
</pre><p>
The above is enough to get you a structured file with format checking
on read.  If you try reading something that is not a player savegame file
or if the file is somehow corrupted, you'll get an informative exception.
The read method above is the simplest implementation, to be used if
you really do not expect things to change at this level. A player will
always have a name, some stats, and stuff in his pockets. But what if
you decided to add, say, a known spell list? The read function will then
break. Sure you can hack up some conversion routine for yourself, but
what about your users who already have an old version of your game? Are
you going to tell them that those fifty four hours of gameplay they
saved will have to be replayed just because you added one lousy feature?
Well, some companies are like that. But with IFF, you have the formats
and sizes in each header, so you can make a more resilient read that will
support new and old formats alike:
</p><pre>
    /// Reads the player object from stream \p is
    void CPlayer::read (istream&amp; is)
    {
	while (is.remaining()) {
	    //
	    // The Peek function will get the format without moving the stream
	    // pointer, handling also the case of compound chunks.
	    //
	    switch (iff::PeekChunkOrGroupFormat (is)) {
		case fmt_PlayerName:  iff::ReadChunk (is, _name,      fmt_PlayerName);  break;
		case fmt_PlayerStats: iff::ReadChunk (is, _stats,     fmt_PlayerStats); break;
		case fmt_Inventory:   iff::ReadVector(is, _inventory, fmt_Inventory);   break;
		case fmt_Quests:      iff::ReadLIST  (is, _quests,    fmt_Quests);      break;
		default:              iff::SkipChunk (is);                               break;
	    }
	}
    }
</pre><p>
This way missing chunks will not cause a problem, resulting in defaults
being used for the corresponding object, and neither will new ones, which
will be skipped. Once you have this set up, changing the file format
becomes more or less easy and painless, both for you and your users.
All this you get for a very small cost of changing simple flow writes
to WriteChunk and the like. As you can see above, the code remains
readable, maintainable, and compact. Finally, if a user sends you his
savefile that reproduces some bug, and you need to find out whether he
was low on mana, you'll be able to find the right number at a glance
in a hex editor; it's bytes 8 and 9 after STAT.
</p>
<h2>Format description</h2>
<p>
The full format description is available in the original
<a href="http://www.martinreddy.net/gfx/2d/IFF.txt">EA85 IFF standard</a>
document, and you are invited to read it. This section provides only a
short and practical summary.
</p><p>
Every IFF file consists of a hierarchy of chunks, each chunk being an
opaque block of data with an 8-byte header specifying the chunk's type
and size. The type field is a 32-bit integer with such a value that it
looks like text when viewed in a hex editor. Typical values are "BODY",
"FORM", or "LIST". The size field is a 32-bit integer specifying the
size of the chunk's data, not including the 8-byte header. For example,
a color palette chunk would start with 4 byte type "CMAP", followed by
the size of the color data, 256*3=768, and followed by 768 bytes of RGB
3-byte values, for a total of 776 bytes in the chunk with header.
</p><p>
Some chunks may contain other chunks. These compound chunks have
format fields FORM, LIST, and CAT, and append a 4 byte contents type
to the chunk header before the child chunks. For example, a FORM chunk
containing two other chunks will start with format field FORM, followed
by the size of the chunk data, which is the number of bytes between the
end of this size field and the end of the last child chunk, followed by
the two child chunks in normal format.
</p><p>
The difference between FORM, LIST, and CAT, is that FORMs can contain
chunks. CATs contain only other containers and are thought of as a
simple aggregation of them without regard for order. LISTs are like CATs,
but may also contain PROP chunks, which are scoped named property values.
</p><p>
The above ideas are the ones present in all the IFF-based formats, which,
believe it or not, still exist. However, it is not very likely that you
will encounter any and when you do, there is a good chance that what you
will find will not be standard compliant. The problematic issues are
byte ordering and chunk alignment. The EA85 specification states that
header integers are to be in big endian byte order and that chunks are
to be aligned on even grain, but every IFF-based format makes up its
own mind about byte order and alignment. This library is no exception,
having chosen little-endian byte order and 4-grain alignment.
</p><p>
Why be incompatible? Because there really aren't all that many IFF files
out there. Aside from Windows .wav files in RIFF format, you are unlikely
to ever encounter one. It is far more likely that you are using this
library to write your own data files, which are not expected to be read by
any old IFF-based software, all of which have been obsolete for decades.
Therefore, it is much better to modify the format a little to fit modern
hardware rather than the old Motorola 68000 for which EA85 IFF standard
was designed.
</p><p>
Why use little-endian byte order? Because pretty much every computer
in the world uses little-endian integers today. Back in 1985 there were
quite a few big-endian machines, including Motorola 68000, and many people
thought that big-endian byte order will eventually become the standard as
Intel heretics convert to the true faith. This was particularly true in
academic circles, which were aggressively lobbied by Sun and its hardware
obtained with substatial educational institution discounts. Over time,
the exact opposite has happened, and the only big-endian machines
remaining are gathering dust in server rooms and antique university
computer labs. The rest of us use Intel or ARM processors, both of which
are little-endian.
</p><p>
As a result, it makes far more sense to use little-endian integers
everywhere, furthering the entrenchment of this now almost universal
standard. Many IFF formats, including its most common variation, the
Microsoft RIFF format, used for .wav files, already use little-endian
integers. In a few more years big-endian format should disappear
completely and all that extra byteswapping work will no longer be
necessary. Until then, it's your choice; will you stick to an old format
for the sake of conformity to an obsolete standard, or embrace the future
and set a new standard that best fits modern hardware? Both options are
supported by the library, via configure.
</p><p>
The second contenuous issue is chunk alignment. The EA85 standard
specifies 2-grain alignment because the 68000 processor could not access
a dword at an odd grain. This is still true, and some modern CPUs also
crash when you try to do that. Intel architecture CPUs do not crash, but
they slow down considerably. In addition, unlike the 68000 processor,
modern CPUs require 4-grain alignment for 32-bit values. This is the
reason for choosing 4-grain as the default alignment in this library.
</p><p>
Why read the integers in this way? Yes, a memcpy or a direct file read
to an address will not suffer from alignment limitations, but it creates
considerably more code. Using direct cast-to-dword-and-dereference method
is the fastest and the most compact way to read stuff into memory. Each
such read compiles to about five instructions, and it is possible that
future compiler improvements will be able to reduce it to three.
</p><p>
Using a larger alignment than required will not even make all that much
difference in most cases, since most data you are likely to be working
with is already sized as a multiple of 4. Microsoft's RIFF format is
the one example known to exist and to already be 4-grain aligned. So
even though most of the files you are likely to find (if you can find
any...) do not align the chunks at all, your chances of being able to read
them with this library compiled with default settings are reasonably good.
